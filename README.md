# Decision_Tree

### Project's Title: Decision_Tree


### Project Description (Problem Statement): 
Suppose we are joining a company that grows and sells wild mushrooms.

* Since not all mushrooms are edible, we would like to be able to tell whether a given mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical attributes
* We have some existing data to use for this task.

Question: Can this data describe, which mushrooms can be sold safely?

### How to Install and Run the Project:

To successfully run this project you have to do the following steps:

	Step 1. Run the "Decision_Tree" Jupyter Notebook file on your PC/Notebook.

	Step 2. Import all required libraries and data frames from the Section "Importing modules".

	Step 3. Import the dataset. Run the cell of the "Dataset" Section for getting previously mentioned project goals due to Decision Tree model execution.

	Step 4. Run each cell with Python code within the Jupyter Notebook file sequentially following the instructions. Moreover, get familiar with a theoretical background and comprehensive interpretations of the employed Machine Learning Model to execute the goals of the underlying problem statement.
